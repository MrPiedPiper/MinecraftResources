MrPiedPiper Recursion V2.1
1.0 -Initial release
2.0 -Now allows multiple test conditions
2.1 -Replaces tags with scoreboards to not clutter the `/tag <selector> list` command


Setup
/scoreboard objectives add PiperRecursion dummy PiperRecursion
(Check help: 
	0: Not checked
	1: Checking
	2: Checked
	3: Matched)

Repeat
(Starts up the chain by making sure that all players are on the scoreboard)
	/scoreboard players add @a PiperRecursion 0
 
Chain
(Sets the score of all players that haven't been tested yet to 1 (checking))
	/scoreboard players set @p[scores={PiperRecursion=0}] PiperRecursion 1
(This tests the player for conditions)
(Test command. Make note of how many test commands you have, because you need the total for this to work.)
	/execute @p[scores={PiperRecursion=1}] ~ ~ ~ <Whatever you want to check for. e.g. testforblocks, clear, ect.>
	<Conditional> /scoreboard players add conditionCheck PiperRecursion 1
(Another test command for a good example)
	/execute @p[scores={PiperRecursion=1}] ~ ~ ~ <Whatever you want to check for. e.g. testforblocks, clear, ect.>
	<Conditional> /scoreboard players add conditionCheck PiperRecursion 1

(This marks the players that passed)
(This tests for if all the tests succeeded. If so, that player gets marked as a successful check. This is where you put the total amount of tests you ran)
	/scoreboard players test conditionCheck PiperRecursion 2 2
	<Conditional> /scoreboard players set @a[scores={PiperRecursion=1}] PiperRecursion 3
(Reset the scoreboard for the next player's check)
	/scoreboard players set conditionCheck PiperRecursion 0

(This will check if all the players online have been checked)
(If the player didn't match, mark the player as checked by setting their score to 2)
	/scoreboard players set @a[scores={PiperRecursion=1}] PiperRecursion 2
(Have any player that is not checked yet set the scoreboard to show this)
	/execute @a[scores={PiperRecursion=0}] ~ ~ ~ /scoreboard players set finishLoopCheck PiperRecursion 1
(If the scoreboard remains unchanged, restart the loop and run any commands you like on the matched players)
	/scoreboard players test finishLoopCheck PiperRecursion 0 0
	<Conditional> /scoreboard players set finishLoopCheck PiperRecursion 2
	<Conditional> <Command(s) you want using @a[scores={PiperRecursion=3}]>
	/scoreboard players test finishLoopCheck PiperRecursion 2 2
	<Conditional> /scoreboard players set @a PiperRecursion 0
	/scoreboard players set finishLoopCheck PiperRecursion 0
